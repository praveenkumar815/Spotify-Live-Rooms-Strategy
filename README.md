## 📄 Project Overview
This project focuses on increasing user time-in-app by solving a key friction point: **The lack of real-time social connection while listening.** Instead of users leaving Spotify to chat on Discord or WhatsApp, "Live Rooms" allows friends to listen in sync and chat directly within the interface.
